	<h1>Privacy Policy for EZ HIJAB</h1>

	<section>
		<p>Good Guise International is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how our mobile
			application, EZ HIJAB ("the App"), collects, uses, and safeguards information related to your use of the
			app. By
			using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

		<h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
		<p>We respect your privacy and are proud to inform you that <strong>EZ HIJAB collects no user data</strong>.
			This
			means we do not gather, store, or process any personally identifiable information (PII), usage statistics,
			or
			metadata from your use of the App. Your photos, data, and activity remain private and are stored solely on
			your
			device.</p>

		<h2>2. Permissions</h2>
		<p>EZ HIJAB requires the following permissions for its core functionality:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Camera Access</strong>: The App requests permission to access your device's camera to allow you
				to
				take photos that you can edit with the app.</li>
			<li><strong>Photo Gallery (Read-Only Access)</strong>: The App requests permission to access your device’s
				photo
				gallery in read-only mode. This access allows you to select existing photos from your gallery to add
				hijabs
				to them. The App does not modify, delete, or otherwise interact with files beyond the selected photo for
				editing.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>3. How We Handle Your Photos</h2>
		<p>All photo editing takes place on your device locally. The photos you edit or create using EZ HIJAB are not
			uploaded, stored, or transmitted to any external servers or third parties.</p>

		<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
		<p>As EZ HIJAB does not collect data, the App does not integrate with or rely on any third-party services for
			analytics, advertising, or user tracking purposes.</p>

		<h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
		<p>EZ HIJAB is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not collect personal information from
			children. As the App does not collect data, there is no risk of unauthorized data collection from minors.
		</p>

			practices
			to protect your personal information and data.</p>

		<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal or
			regulatory reasons. When we update the Privacy Policy, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top.
			Your
			continued use of EZ HIJAB after any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of those
			changes.
